Stroke

Stroke is a port of the C++ Swift library ( http://swift.im/swiften/ )
The source is available from the Git repository at http://swift.im/git/stroke/

It depends on the XmlPullParser from http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xgws/xsoap/xpp/mxp1/index.html. This is passed to Ant in the xpp-dir parameter. The passed folder should contain the XPP jar called xpp.jar (i.e. with no version numbering in the filename).

It also depends upon http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/, which is passed to ant in the jzlib-dir parameter. The passed folder should contain a jar called jzlib.jar.

To build, run:
ant  -Dxpp-dir=path/to/directory/containing/xpp -Djzlib-dir=path/to/directory/containing/jzlib


Easy version:
The included Makefile should, on Unixes with make/curl installed, grab the dependencies (once only) and build.
