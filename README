Stroke

Stroke is a port of the C++ Swift library ( http://swift.im/swiften/ )
The source is available from the Git repository at http://swift.im/git/stroke/

For XML parsing, Stroke depends on the Aalto XML Parser and the STAX2 API, from http://wiki.fasterxml.com/AaltoHome

It also depends upon http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/, which is passed to ant in the jzlib-dir parameter. The passed folder should contain a jar called jzlib.jar.

It also depends upon icu4j from http://site.icu-project.org/

It also depends upon dnsjava from http://www.dnsjava.org/


To build, run:
ant -Dxpp-dir=third-party/xpp -Djzlib-dir=third-party/jzlib -Dicu4j-dir=third-party/ -Dstax2-dir=third-party/stax2/ -Daalto-dir=third-party/aalto/
