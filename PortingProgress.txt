Individual Comments:
Java's inbuilt Crypto Provider used.
In Network Factories we are not porting getConnectionServerFactory(), getNATTraverser() and getNetworkEnvironment() as second two are hard to port and
getConnectionServerFactory() is for building servers.

Individual Comments:
Incoming and Outgoing Jingle File Transfer have been implemented 
slightly differently to swiften due to multipe inheritance.

IncomingJingleFileTransferTest -- test_AcceptFailingS5BFallsBackToIBB test commented
out in Swiften code this test is not run as it does not work in Swiften.

Network:

All files ported to 6ca201d0b48f4273e24dd7bff17c4a46eeaddf39 except for:

GConfProxyProvider, UnixProxyProvider, WindowsProxyProvider, MacOSXProxyProvider
-- No need to port.  We already have a JavaProxyProvider.

SolarisNetworkEnvironment, UnixNetworkEnvironment, WindowsNetworkEnvironment, PlatformNATTraversalWorker 
-- No need to port.  A JavaNetworkEnviroment has been implemented.

HostNameOrAddress -- No need to port. Just a utiltity method to allow .toString to be called on something
that is either HostName or a String.  We can do this in java with Object.toString().

MiniUPnPInterface, NATPMPInterface -- Not yet ported. These are difficult to import, we are using libminiupnpc which we do not have
a java equivalent for?

PlatformDomainNameServiceQuery -- Constructor needs change.  Swiften version has an extra field required in constructor that is used
for swiften implementation but not in stroke so this is not needed.

UnboundDomainNameResolver -- Not yet ported, uses unbound Library which we do not have a java equivalent for?
